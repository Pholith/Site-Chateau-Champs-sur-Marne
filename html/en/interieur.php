<h2> The dining room</h2>
<h3> History of the dining room</h3>
<div class="contenuTitre2">
   <div>
      <p> Nowadays, it seems quite common to have a room exclusively dedicated to eat. However, it has not always been the case!</p>
      <button class="enSavoirPlus" onclick="enSavoirPlus(this);"> To know more<span class="arrow"> </span>
      </button>
      <p class="contenuPlus"> Until end of the 18th century, temporary tables were used in anterooms because they could be dismantled and installed whererever you wanted to eat. That's where the expression "setting the table" comes from. So, there was not necessary a dining room as so called because the tradition was to set up where you wanted to.</p>

      <p> However, the Champs-sur-Marne's castle stood out from this tradition by creating this majestic dining room. It was one of the first dining room in France. Placed above the effective kitchen, this room was so innovative and visionary for that time.</p>

   </div>
</div>
<h3> A room dedicated to catering</h3>
<div class="contenuTitre2">
   <p> An imposing table is set in the middle of the room, encircled by luxurious seats. The guests, some of them very famous, ate refined meals brought by servants. The duke de la Vallière received for example the french philosopher Voltaire. While they were eating, guests could admire the Louis XV statue (dressed as a Roman emperor) and the brass clock.</p>

      <p class="contenuPlus"> Charles Cahen d’Anvers and his wife were looking for a work of art but they did not find. Indeed, not any paintings with hunting theme was as large as the frame. So, they decided to buy 2 different canvases. The first one shows a pleasure house with a big garden and the other a hunting scene in a forest. The two paintings have been carefully joined by a painter. If you pay attention, we can notice some traces of the unification in the river. The two works make only one in appearance.</p>
